prtime
======

This is a small utility to print the timestamp from the logsurfer dumpfile
in a more human readable form. It will either convert the given timestamp
to the date and time representation of your local machine or it will print
the offset in seconds until the timestamp will be reached.

Compile it with: "cc -o prtime prtime.c"


usage: prtime [-o] timestamp

Examples:

% prtime 821179449
Tue Jan  9 10:24:09 1996

% prtime -o 821179454
5 seconds offset
