Version 1.7 (logsurfer+)
	+ added -e option to begin processing from the current end
	  of the input log file ( normally used with -f )
	+ put double-quotes around regex expressions in dump file
	+ if the context argument to a pipe or report action is "-"
	  then the current context contents are piped into the command
	  this should shorten most context definitions
        + added new action "echo" which simply echo's the output on
          stdout, or to a file with optional >file & >>file 1st arg
	+ added a macro construct in context action fields, if "$lines"
	  exists in a context action (such as a command line) it will
	  be substituted by the number of lines in the context
	+ added syslog action to send a message into syslog
	  the first argument must be facility:level, the second arg
	  is a string to send to syslog

Version 1.6b (logsurfer+)
	+ fixed -t option in getopts()

Version 1.6a (logsurfer+)
	Kerry Thompson kerry@crypt.gen.nz:
	+ corrected off-by-one in min_lines checking
	+ added min_lines context arg to logsurfer.conf man page

Version 1.6 (logsurfer+)
	Kerry Thompson kerry@crypt.gen.nz:
	+ added an optional parameter at the end of context definition
	  (just before action) specifying the minimum number of lines
	  collected which needs to be satisfied before performing action
	+ added -t option to explicity timeout contexts when exiting
	  default=off so contexts don't all trigger when we shut down
	+ only add lines to a context if the context has an action of
	  'pipe' or 'report'. In other words, don't store lines in
	  memory which won't ever be used. The number of matching
	  lines in the context is still incremented. This allows contexts
	  to be created which can notify if we _don't_ see an event, such
	  as regular "syslog pings" from hosts.
	
Version 1.5b
	+ Corrected off-by-one heap overflow and uninitialized pointer

Version 1.5a
	+ Corrected minor bug in context timeouts

Version 1.5
	+ Added y2k disclaimer
	+ Corrected authorship and copyright information
	+ Released

Version 1.5beta2
	+ Patch for context linelimit added
	+ Changed Logsurfer URL to http://www.cert.dfn.de/eng/logsurf/

Version 1.5beta
	+ Changed default dumpfile to /dev/null to avoid security problems.
	  You can specify the default location for the logsurfer.dump file
	  in the Makefile (see DEF_DUMPFILE). However - be aware that if using
	  a public writable directory someone can crate a sym-link for that
	  name and you'll write to another file. So I would suggest to use
	  the "-d" option while starting logsurfer to specify a dumpfilename.
	+ Added -DWARN_ROOT to print a warning if logsurfer is running as root.
	+ Added generic GNU "INSTALL" file
	+ Corrected version number in Makefile

Version 1.41
	+ deleted two #error defines which caused problems on non
	  ansi-compilers

Version 1.4
	+ fixed serious bug: rule processing stopped if a match_regex was
	  found (even if the not_match_regex dropped this rule)
	+ setup www-page http://www.cert.dfn.de/eng/team/wl/logsurfer/

Version 1.3
	+ removed #error directive (this is only available on ansi
	  compilers)
	+ added output of logsurfer version number in the usage
	  output

Version 1.2
	+ updated manpage of logsurfer.1 to include -f and the new
	  -p option
	+ added -p option to write pid to a file (for easier restarts)
	+ changed line handling to be independent from line length
	  (no fixed buffers for processing stuff)
	+ added --with-etcdir option for configure to specify the
	  default location of the logsurfer.conf file
	+ new "contrib" directory to collect helpful tools (added a script
	  "start-mail" and a tool "prtime" to start the collection)
	+ added a check if "const" is defined or not
	+ sendmail flushing has been improved (but is still not completly
	  reliable - it is only implemented as an additional help for
	  flushing the sendmail queue beside the time sendmail does it
	  by itself)
	+ -DSENDMAIL_FLUSH is now not longer default
	+ LDFLAGS in Makefile.in corrected
	+ trying to report linenumber on configuration errors
	+ the behaviour or fgets() at EOF is not portable - now using read()
	+ all header defines also for non ANSI C compilers available
	+ added sys/resource.h include because AIX header files are broken
	+ added srcdir and VPATH definition to Makefiles
	+ changed all #include "../config.h" to #include <config.h>
	+ added Makefile.in in man/ and src/ dir
	+ added PostScript version of regex documentation to package
	+ merged configure.in from the old regex dir to the new global one
	+ removed regex-0.12 dir and included regex.c and regex.h in the
	  logsurfer source dir

Version 1.1
	+ splited the code into several peaces
	+ wrote a draft manual page
