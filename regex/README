The logsurfer package uses the GNU regex-0.12 library for pattern matching
with regular expressions. The files "regex.c" and "regex.h" in the source
dir of the logsurfer are derived from this package (with only one minor
change in regex.c: instead of #include "config.h" we are now using
#include <config.h> to support system wide config.h files).

The complete regex package includes additional a (very good!) documentation
in texinfo format. The logsurfer is coming with a postscript version of that
documentation (because a lot of people haven't installed tex or makeinfo).

The original regex package also includes some more text files (AUTORS,
Copying, ChangeLog, ...) and a test suite.

The complete regex-library distribution is available via anymous ftp from
  ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/regex-0.12.tar.gz
or from any other GNU mirror.
